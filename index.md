title: 15-411 Compiler Design
layout: default
---

This course covers the design and implementation of compiler and runtime systems for high-level languages, and examines the interaction between language design, compiler design, and runtime organization. Topics covered include lexical and syntactic analysis, type-checking, program analysis, code generation and optimization, memory management, and runtime organization.

Please see the calendar for the lecture topics and links to the references and notes. The schedule is subject to change during the course of the semester.

Lecture is your primary source of information in this course. The course notes and texts are supplementary to lecture, rather than the primary sources of information. You are strongly urged to attend lecture every week, and are in any case responsible for the material presented in lecture. Andrew Appel's Modern Compiler Implementation in ML is an optional textbook, if you really like textbooks.

Additionally, because your compilers will target x86-64 assembly, Chapter 3 of the second or (even better) the third edition of Bryant and O'Hallaron's Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective, or some equivalent reference, will be indespensible. The posted slides from 213, or your own 213 notes, will probably suffice.
